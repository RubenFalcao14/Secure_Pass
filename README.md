# Secure Pass

## Overview :-
A password manager is essentially an encrypted digital vault that stores secure password login
information you use to access apps and accounts on your mobile device, websites and other
services.
To start using the password manager, first you need to create your account using your gmail
account. Then you can start saving your passwords in the app securely.
